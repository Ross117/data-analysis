This repository contains data analysis scripts I've written in Python (using pandas & sometimes NumPy) for the purpose of practising my skills.

The Demographic Data Analysis & Medical Data Visualisation scripts are from freeCodeCamp projects (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

The other are solutions to Preppin' Data challenges (https://www.preppindata.com/).
